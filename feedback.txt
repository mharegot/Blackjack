- Overview 95.6/100
--------------------------

Overall, this was a good project. You completed a non-trivial application
without heavy reliance on existing assets and tutorials. In other words, your
team did a lot completely on your own. Great job on animations and game flow. I
like the 3D assets you used. And the care you spent on realistically handling
the chips. Consider compiling this program for webgl and hosting the demo from
github. 

Your usage of git was terrific. Good use of github and branches. 

Some suggestions for improvements:
- Integrate assets (background images/fonts) to make the UI prettier.
- Add more HUD elements to make it clear how much money your opponents have  
- Do you show when an opponent busts?
- Try making the cards 'non-illuminated' so that they are brighter and easier to see
- Don't put the Hit/Stand buttons on top of the player's cards
- Add text to tell user that they are out of money

Based on evaluations and git history, it looks like everyone contributed to 
the final project in a non-trivial way (see stats/index.html for details). 
April author of the month goes to David and May author of the month goes to Alex. 
Most cummulated added lines goes to David. Good work all!

(35 points) Source code: 

-1 It is customary to include the git clone command to make it easier for the user
-1 Please include the scene to load; No instructions on how to build and run
your backend tests

However, I was able to build and run without problems.

(15 points) Test code: 

-2 Would be good to include scenes for testing Unity elements
